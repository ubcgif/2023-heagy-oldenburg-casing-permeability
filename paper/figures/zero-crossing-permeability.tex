\caption{
    Depth slice of the imaginary component of the electric field just beneath the surface (z=-2.5m) for (a) a well with $\mu_r=1$ and (b) a well with $\mu_r=150$. The white line denotes the contour where the radial electric field is zero. In (c) and (d) we show contours of the radial electric field; red denotes positive values and blue are negative. In (e), we show the location of the zero-crossing for a range of casing permeabilities. The well is located at the origin (x=0m, y=0m). The transmitter wire runs from x=0m to x=500m along the y=0 line, as was shown in Figure \ref{fig:setup}a.
