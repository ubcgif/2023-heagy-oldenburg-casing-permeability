\caption{Cross sections of the real component of the current density in frequency domain EM experiments over (a) a half-space, (b) a conductive well ($5\times10^6$ S/m, $\mu_0$), and (c) a conductive, permeable well ($5\times10^6$ S/m, $150\mu_0$). The panel on the right shows (d) the difference between the conductive, permeable well and the conductive well.
