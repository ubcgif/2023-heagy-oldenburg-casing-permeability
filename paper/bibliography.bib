	abstract = {The work in this paper is motivated by the increasing use of electrical and electromagnetic methods in geoscience problems where steel-cased wells are present. Applications of interest include monitoring carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. Also of interest is detecting flaws or breaks in degrading steel-casings—such wells pose serious environmental hazards. The general principles of electrical methods with steel-cased wells are understood and several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel-cased wells can be beneficial for detecting signal due to targets at depth. However, the success of a direct current (DC) resistivity survey lies in the details. Secondary signals might only be a few per cent of the primary signal. In designing a survey, the geometry of the source and receivers, and whether the source is at the top of the casing, inside of it, or beneath the casing will impact measured responses. Also the physical properties and geometry of the background geology, target and casing will have a large impact on the measured data. Because of the small values of the diagnostic signals, it is important to understand the detailed physics of the problem and also to be able to carry out accurate simulations. This latter task is computationally challenging because of the extreme geometry of the wells, which extend kilometers in depth but have millimeter variations in the radial direction, and the extreme variation in the electrical conductivity which is typically 5–7 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background geology.In this paper, we adopt a cylindrical discretization for numerical simulations to investigate three important aspects of DC resistivity in settings with steel-cased wells. (1) We examine the feasibility of using a surface-based DC resistivity survey for diagnosing impairments along a well in a casing integrity experiment. This parameter study demonstrates the impact of the background conductivity, the conductivity of the casing, the depth of the flaw, and the proportion of the casing circumference that is compromised on amplitude of the secondary electric fields measured at the surface. (2) Next, we consider elements of survey design for exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth. We show that conductive targets generate stronger secondary responses than resistive targets, and that having an electrical connection between the target and well can significantly increase the measured secondary responses. (3) Finally, we examine common strategies for approximating the fine-scale structure of a steel cased well with a coarse-scale representation to reduce computational load. We show that for DC resistivity experiments, the product of the conductivity and the cross-sectional area of the casing is the important quantity for controlling the distribution of currents and charges along its length.To promote insight into the physics, we present results by plotting the currents, charges, and electric fields in each of the scenarios examined. All of the examples shown in this paper are built on open-source software and are available as Jupyter notebooks.},

The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver.

	abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

	abstract = {As motivation for considering new electromagnetic techniques for hydraulic fracture monitoring, we develop a simple financial model for the net present value offered by geophysical characterization to reduce the error in stimulated reservoir volume calculations. This model shows that even a 5\% improvement in stimulated reservoir volume for a 1 billion barrel (bbl.) field results in over 1 billion U.S. dollars (US\$) in net present value over 24 years for US\$100/bbl. oil and US\$0.5 billion for US\$50/bbl. oil. The application of conductivity upscaling, often used in electromagnetic modeling to reduce mesh size and thus simulation runtimes, is shown to be inaccurate for the high electrical contrasts needed to represent steel-cased wells in the earth. Fine-scale finite-difference modeling with 12.22-mm cells to capture the steel casing and fractures shows that the steel casing provides a direct current pathway to a created fracture that significantly enhances the response compared with neglecting the steel casing. We consider conductively enhanced proppant, such as coke-breeze-coated sand, and a highly saline brine solution to produce electrically conductive fractures. For a relatively small frac job at a depth of 3 km, involving 5,000 bbl. of slurry and a source midpoint to receiver separation of 50 m, the models show that the conductively enhanced proppant produces a 15\% increase in the electric field strength (in-line with the transmitter) in a 10-Ωm background. In a 100-Ωm background, the response due to the proppant increases to 213\%. Replacing the conductive proppant by brine with a concentration of 100,000-ppm NaCl, the field strength is increased by 23\% in the 100-Ωm background and by 2.3\% in the 10-Ωm background. All but the 100,000-ppm NaCl brine in a 10-Ωm background produce calculated fracture-induced electric field increases that are significantly above 2\%, a value that has been demonstrated to be observable in field measurements.},

The University of Toronto has deployed a permanent seafloor time-domain controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) system offshore Vancouver Island, within the framework of the NEPTUNE Canada underwater cabled obser-vatory. Hydrates are known to be present in the area and due to their electrically resistive nature can be monitored by 5 permanent electric field receivers. However, two cased boreholes may be drilled near the CSEM site in the near future. To un-derstand any potential distortions of the electric fields due to the metal, we model the marine electromagnetic response of a conductive steel borehole casing. First, we consider the commonly used canonical model consisting of a 100m, 100 m thick resistive hydrocarbon layer embedded at a depth of 1000 m in a 1m conductive host medium, with the addition of a typical steel production casing extending from the seafloor to the resistive zone. Results show that in both the frequency and time domains the distortion produced by the casing occurs at smaller transmitter-receiver offsets than the offsets required to detect the resistive layer. Second, we consider the experimentally determined model of the offshore Vancouver Island hydrate zone, consisting of a 5.5m, 36m thick hydrate layer overlying a 0.7m sedimentary half-space, with the addition of two borehole casings extending 300 m into the seafloor. In this case, results show that the distortion produced by casings located within a 100 m safety zone of the CSEM system will be measured at 4 of the 5 receivers. We conclude that the boreholes must be positioned at least 200 m away from the CSEM array so as to minimize the effects of the casings.},

	abstract = {The presence of steel-cased wells and other infrastructure causes a significant change in the electromagnetic fields that has to be taken into consideration in modeling and interpretation of field data. A realistic and accurate simulation requires the borehole casing to be incorporated into the modeling scheme, which is numerically challenging. Due to the huge conductivity contrast between the casing and surrounding media, a spatial discretization that provides accurate results at different spatial scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of meters is required. In this paper, we present a full 3D frequency-domain electromagnetic modeling based on a parallel finite-difference algorithm considering the casing effect and investigate its applicability on the borehole-to-surface configuration of the Hontom\{í\}n CO2 storage site. To guarantee a robust solution of linear systems with highly ill-conditioned matrices caused by huge conductivity contrasts and multiple spatial scales in the model, we employ direct sparse solvers. Different scenarios are simulated in order to study the influence of the source position, conductivity model, and the effect of the steel casing on the measured data. Several approximations of the real hollow casing that allow for a large reduction in the number of elements in the resulting meshes are studied. A good agreement between the modeled responses and the real field data demonstrates the feasibility of simulating casing effects in complex geological areas. The steel casing of the well greatly increases the amplitude of the surface electromagnetic fields and thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity to deep targets.},

	doi = {10.1190/1.1443388},
	abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

Application of transmission line theory is based on the fact that the electric field in the formation is radial within the intermediate zone, re- sulting in the conclusion that the vertical resolution of such a measurement would depend only upon the spacing of the electrodes required to estimate the second derivative of the potential.},

	abstract = {Methods using dc electrical arrays to measure for- mation resistivity through casing have relied on ap- proximate forms for the current and potential distribu- tions to derive a simple relationship between the formation resistivity and the transverse resistance calculated from measurements of the potential and its second derivative inside the casing. We have derived a numerical solution for the potentials and their deriva- tives to examine the accuracy of the approximate forms for casing of finite-length, annular zones of varying radius, and for vertical discontinuities such as layers or abrupt changes in annular zone radius. For typical conductivity contrasts between the casing and formation, the approximate relationships may be off by as much as 60 percent for long casing and may show variations of 20 to 30 percent as the electrode array moves along the casing. In principle an iterative scheme could be devised to correct the readings if high accuracy was required. The numerical results show that to first order the current flow from the casing is radial, and that all the analytic expressions based on this assumption for evaluating layer resolution and the effects of annular layers are valid. An interesting byproduct of this study has been the discovery that the distortion of the potentials in a nearby well by an annular disk (e.g., an injected steam zone) surrounding the current injection well is greater if the injection well is cased. Crosswell resistivity surveys appear feasible if one of the wells is cased},

	abstract = {We present a numerical study for 3D time-lapse electromagnetic monitoring of a fictitious CO2 sequestration using the geometry of a real geological site and a suite of suitable electromagnetic methods with different source/receiver configurations and different sensitivity patterns. All available geological information is processed and directly implemented into the computational domain, which is discretized by unstructured tetrahedral grids. We thus demonstrate the performance capability of our numerical simulation techniques. The scenario considers a CO2 injection in approximately 1100 m depth. The expected changes in conductivity were inferred from preceding laboratory measurements. A resistive anomaly is caused within the conductive brines of the undisturbed reservoir horizon. The resistive nature of the anomaly is enhanced by the CO2 dissolution regime, which prevails in the high-salinity environment. Due to the physicochemical properties of CO2, the affected portion of the subsurface is laterally widespread but very thin. We combine controlled-source electromagnetics, borehole transient electromagnetics, and the direct-current resistivity method to perform a virtual experiment with the aim of scrutinizing a set of source/receiver configurations with respect to coverage, resolution, and detectability of the anomalous CO2 plume prior to the field survey. Our simulation studies are carried out using the 3D codes developed in our working group. They are all based on linear and higher order Lagrange and Nédélec finite-element formulations on unstructured grids, providing the necessary flexibility with respect to the complex real-world geometry. We provide different strategies for addressing the accuracy of numerical simulations in the case of arbitrary structures. The presented computations demonstrate the expected great advantage of positioning transmitters or receivers close to the target. For direct-current geoelectrics, 50\% change in electric potential may be detected even at the Earth's surface. Monitoring with inductive methods is also promising. For a well-positioned surface transmitter, more than 10\% difference in the vertical electric field is predicted for a receiver located 200 m above the target. Our borehole transient electromagnetics results demonstrate that traditional transient electromagnetics with a vertical magnetic dipole source is not well suited for monitoring a thin horizontal resistive target. This is due to the mainly horizontal current system, which is induced by a vertical magnetic dipole.},

	abstract = {We study the theoretical response of electromagnetically energized steel casing in the presence of subsurface variations of electrical resistivity. Casing is energized with a finite-size solenoid antenna located along the axis of the borehole. Measurements consist of the azimuthal component of the electric field acquired either on the surface or in a separate well in the same hydrocarbon field. We assume two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric variations of subsurface electrical resistivity and casing excitation. Simulations of electromagnetic (EM) fields excited by energized steel casing are performed with a goal-oriented hp-adaptive finite-element method that automatically generates a sequence of optimal grids delivering exponential convergence rates in terms of the EM fields at the receiver antennas against CPU time. This advanced finite-element method enables accu-rate modeling of problems with high conductivity contrasts inlarge computational domains. Numerical simulations quantify the measurement sensitivity to variations of frequency, distance from casing to receivers, resistivity of the target oil-bearing layer, and pistonlike radial invasion of water within a target layer initially saturated with oil. When receivers are placed in a nearby well, numerical results indicate that measurements exhibit the largest sensitivity to the target (oil-saturated) layer when the transmitter or receiver antenna is located just above the target layer, and another antenna is located below the target layer. A frequency range from 5-30 Hz provides optimal results for the detection of oil-bearing layers and estimation of radial extent of water invasion. Large horizontal distances (up to 1500 m) between transmitter and receivers and a background material with resistivity above 50 Omega m also enhance the measurement sensitivity to radial variations of water invasion. This sensitivity can be as large as 15\%-20\% of the measured electric field.},

Truly, there are few published examples of land CSEM surveys carried out completely analogously to the current marine CSEM standard approach of towing a bipole source across an array of stationary receivers, continuously transmitting a low-frequency signal and interpreting the data in the frequency domain. Rather, different sensitivity properties of different exploration targets in diverse geological settings, gradual advances in theoretical understanding, acquisition and computer technology, and different schools in different parts of the world have resulted in a sometimes confusing multitude of land-based controlled-source EM surveying approaches. Here, I aim to review previous and present-day approaches, and provide reasoning for their diversity. I focus on surface-based techniques while excluding airborne EM and well logging and on applications for hydrocarbon exploration. Attempts at the very demanding task of using onshore controlled-source EM for reservoir monitoring are shown, and the possible future potential of EM monitoring is discussed.},

We use a 3-D code based on finite-difference method, developed by Wang and Hohmann [Geophysics 58 (1993) 797], to study transient electromagnetic field propagation through a medium containing bodies with both anomalous conductivity and anomalous magnetic permeability. The remarkable result is that the combination of anomalous conductivity and permeability within the same body could increase significantly the anomalous TDEM response in comparison with purely conductive or purely magnetic anomalies. This effect has to be taken into account in interpretation of TDEM data over electrical inhomogeneous structures with potentially anomalous magnetic permeability. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In some surveys, well-casings have been used as `extended electrodes' for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modeling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modeling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modeling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes, and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on direct current resistivity and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells.

To realize the CSEM response, a new 3-D CSEM forward modelling algorithm based on an edge finite element method for both electrically conductive and magnetically permeable heterogeneities is developed. The algorithm shows highly accurate results in validation tests against a semi-analytic solution for stratified earth and an integral form of the scattered field. We describe the vector behaviour of an anomalous magnetic field originating from a conductive and permeable anomaly when the loop sources are deployed over a conductive half-space. The CSEM response of the conductive and permeable anomaly is classified into three effects originating from: conductivity perturbations, permeability perturbations and the coupling of these two effects. The separated individual results and the corresponding integral equation form of the anomalous field help to better understand the physical behaviour. We confirm the characteristic features of the CSEM response from the conductive and permeable anomaly, for example, (1) the general dominance of the induction effect in the out-of-phase response accompanied by a non-negligible magnetization effect from the magnetic anomaly in a conductive half-space and (2) the dominance of near frequency-independent magnetization effects in the in-phase response at relatively low frequencies and change in ruling part of the in-phase response into the induction effect as the frequency increases. We also demonstrate the effect of coupling mode and show that its maximum contribution is limited to a few per cent level of other two modes, induction and magnetization mode, even when the heterogeneity of our model is strong. In our synthetic survey, using examples of land-based profiling surveys of low induction number and intermediate regime, we find that the effect of magnetization can be used as an indicator of the existence of magnetic material. One important point to note from this study is the importance of accurate cancelling-out or estimation of free-space responses, which can mask the magnetic responses to imaging the varying magnetic property.},

	volume = {64},
	doi = {10.1190/1.1826608},
	abstract = {In this paper we develop an inversion algorithm to simultaneously recover conductivity and susceptibility distributions from a single data set. The earth is modeled as a series of homogeneous layers of known thickness with constant but unknown conductivities and susceptibilities. The medium of interest is illuminated by a horizontal circular loop source located above the surface of the earth. The reflected signals from the earth are picked up by a circular loop receiver separated some distance from the source. The model objective function in the inversion, which we refer to as the cost function, is a weighted sum of model objective functions of conductivity and susceptibility. We minimize this cost function subject to the data constraints. At each iteration, perturbations to both electric and magnetic properties are simultaneously obtained. We investigate the fundamental nonuniqueness in the inversion and discuss possible ways to cope with it. Nonuniqueness arises because the two model parameters are strongly coupled. In the quasi-static assumption ? and ? appear as a pair in the term i??? and hence there is no way to distinguish between them. The effect of susceptibility appears by itself only in the boundary conditions. Synthetic and field data were inverted to show the usefulness of the algorithm. From these examples it is concluded that simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic (EM) data can provide useful information about the conductivity and susceptibility distributions but it may be that more information is required to help determine which final model is desirable.},

	abstract = {Wellbore integrity is of paramount importance to subsurface resource extraction, energy storage, and hazardous waste disposal. We have developed a simple noninvasive technology for casing integrity screening, based on the continuity of electrical current flow. Applying low-frequency current to a wellhead, with a distant return electrode, produces a casing current dependent on the background formation and the properties and depth extent of the well casing. These currents in turn generate surface electrical fields that can be captured in a radial profile and can be used to analyze properties of the well casing. Numerical modeling results reveal a strong relation of the electric field to the casing properties and depth extent of the well. A small breakage in the casing produces a profile coincident to a cased well with a completion depth above the break. A corroded patch, in which the casing conductivity is reduced, also alters the field profiles, and its depth may be estimated by comparing to the profile expected from the well completion diagrams. The electric field profiles are also strongly dependent on background resistivity distributions and on whether the well was drilled using water-or oil-based drilling fluids. We validate the proof of concept in a field experiment, in which we apply currents at the wellheads of two adjacent wells with different casing lengths in an area of known background resistivity. The two profiles are similar in appearance but are offset in amplitude by more than a factor of five, consistent with the theoretical analysis and the 3D modeling results. These results demonstrate that our approach has promise for mapping the general casing condition without well intervention. This approach can be a practical and effective tool for rapidly screening several wells before expensive logging-based technologies are used for casing inspection in detail.},

	abstract = {As understanding of the risks and damages of climate change has improved, almost all nations have committed to limit total global warming to less than 2°C over preindustrial levels, with an aspirational target of 1.5°C. Meeting a 2°C target is becoming exceedingly challenging; the global mean temperature has already risen about 1°C over the 20th century. Most climate and integrated assessment models project that the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would have to stop increasing (and perhaps start decreasing) by the second half of the century for there to be a reasonable chance of limiting warming and the associated dangerous climate impacts. Fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, land-use change, and cement production are the dominant anthropogenic sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The focus of climate mitigation is to reduce energy sector emissions by 80-100\%, requiring massive deployment of low-carbon technologies between now and 2050. Progress toward these targets could be made by deploying Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), which remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it. Under the present conditions, where fossil CO2 is continuously added to the atmosphere, removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it has exactly the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing emission of an equal amount of CO2. NETs have been part of the portfolio to achieve net emissions reductions, at least since reforestation, afforestation, and soil sequestration were brought into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, albeit as mitigation options, more than two decades ago. Recent analyses found that deploying NETs may be less expensive and less disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation emissions. In 2015, the National Academies published Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration, which described and initially assessed NETs and sequestration technologies. This report acknowledged the relative paucity of research on NETs and recommended development of a research agenda that covers all aspects of NETs from fundamental science to full-scale deployment. To address this need, the National Academies convened the Committee on Developing a Research Agenda for Carbon Dioxide Removal and Sequestration to assess the benefits, risks, and “sustainable scale potential” for NETs and sequestration and to define the essential components of a research and development program, including its estimated costs and potential impact (Box S.1). The full Statement of Task is presented in Box 1.3. The committee held a series of public workshops and meetings to inform its deliberations and the writing of this report. MITIGATION},

	abstract = {Well integrity is one of the major concerns in long-term geologic storage sites due to its potential risk for well leakage and groundwater contamination. Evaluating changes in electrical responses due to energized steel-cased wells has the potential to quantify and predict possible wellbore failures, as any kind of breakage or corrosion along highly-conductive well casings will have an impact on the distribution of subsurface electrical potential. However, realistic wellbore-geoelectrical models that can fully capture fine scale details of well completion design and the state of well damage at the field scale require extensive computational e.ort, or can even be intractable to simulate. To overcome this computational burden while still keeping the model realistic, we use the hierarchical finite element method which represents electrical conductivity at each dimensional component (1-D edges, 2-D planes and 3-D cells) of a tetrahedra mesh. This allows well completion designs with real-life geometric scales and well systems with realistic, detailed, progressive corrosion and damage in our models. Here, we present a comparison of possible discretization approaches of a multi-casing completion design in the finite-element model. The e.ects of the surface casing length and the coupling between concentric well casings, as well as the e.ects of the degree and the location of well damage on the electrical responses are also examined. Finally, we analyze real surface electric field data to detect wellbore integrity failure associated with damage.},

	abstract = {The electrical rock conductivity is a sensitive indicator for carbon dioxide (CO2) injection and migration processes. For a reliable balancing of the free CO2 in pore space with petrophysical models such as Archie's law or for the detection of migrating CO2, detailed knowledge of the pore water conductivity during interaction with CO2 is essential but not available yet. Contrary to common assumptions, pore water conductivity cannot be assumed constant since CO2 is a reactive gas that dissolves into the pore water in large amounts and provides additional charge carriers due to the dissociation of carbonic acid. We consequently carried out systematic laboratory experiments to quantify and analyse the changes in saline pore water conductivity caused by CO2 at thermodynamic equilibrium. Electrical conductivity is measured on pore water samples for pressures up to 30 MPa and temperatures up to 80°C. The parameter range covers the gaseous, liquid and supercritical state of the CO2 involved. Pore water salinities from 0.006 up to 57.27 g L-1 sodium chloride were investigated as well as selective other ion species. At the same time, the CO2 concentration in the salt solution was determined by a wet-chemical procedure. A two-regime behaviour appears: for small salinities, we observe an increase of up to more than factor 3 in the electrical pore water conductivity, which strongly depends on the solution salinity (low-salinity regime). This is an expected behaviour, since the additional ions originating from the dissociation of carbonic acid positively contribute to the solution conductivity. However, when increasing salinities are considered this effect is completely diminished. For highly saline solutions, the increased mutual impeding causes the mobility of all ions to decrease, which may result in a significant reduction of conductivity by up to 15 per cent despite the added CO2 (high-salinity regime). We present the data set covering the pressure, temperature, salinity and ion species dependence of the CO2 effect. Furthermore, the observations are analysed and predicted with a semi-analytical formulation for the electrical pore water conductivity taking into account the species' interactions. For the applicability of our results in practice of exploration and monitoring, we additionally provide a purely empirical formulation to compute the impact of CO2 on pore water conductivity at equilibrium which only requires the input of pressure, temperature and salinity information.},

Therefore, we developed an experimental set-up that allows to investigate electrical characteristics of the injection process as well as the impact of dissolved CO2 on pore water conductivity. We found that a gaseous, fluid and supercritical pure CO2 phase bears no relevant conductivity at pressures up to 13 MPa and temperatures up to 50° C. When CO2 dissolves in pore water, pressure-dependent dissociation processes can double the pore water conductivity, that can be used in leakage detection. This is quantified by an adaptation of Archie's law. The empirical adaptation and the experimental data are confirmed by combined geochemical-geoelectrical modelling. Furthermore, water-saturated sand samples were investigated while CO2 displaced the pore water at pressures up to 13 MPa and temperatures up to 40° C. A decrease in electrical conductivity by a factor of up to 33 was measured, corresponding to a residual water saturation of 14-19\%. Qualitatively, a decrease was also demonstrated under supercritical conditions.

	abstract = {Over the last decades, electromagnetic methods have become an accepted tool for a wide range of geophysical exploration purposes and nowadays even for monitoring. Application to hydrocarbon monitoring, for example for enhanced oil recovery, is hampered by steel-cased wells, which typically exist in large numbers in producing oil fields and which distort electromagnetic fields in the subsurface. Steel casings have complex geometries as they are very thin but vertically extended; moreover, the conductivity contrast of steel to natural materials is in the range of six orders of magnitude. It is therefore computationally prohibitively costly to include such structures directly into the modelling grid, even for finite element methods. To tackle the problem we developed a method to describe steel-cased wells as series of substitute dipole sources, which effectively interact with the primary field. The new approach cannot only handle a single steel-cased well, but also an arbitrary number, and their interaction with each other. We illustrate the metal casing effect with synthetic 3-D modelling of land-based controlled source electromagnetic data. Steel casings distort electromagnetic fields even for large borehole-transmitter distances above 2 km. The effect depends not only on the distance between casing and transmitter, but also on the orientation of the transmitter to the borehole. Finally, we demonstrate how the presence of steel-cased wells can be exploited to increase the sensitivity and enhance resolution in the target region. Our results show that it is at least advisable to consider the distribution of steel-cased wells already at the planning phase of a controlled source electromagnetic field campaign.},

We investigate the applicability of controlled-source electromagnetic methods to monitor fluid movements in a German oilfield (Bockstedt, onshore Northwest Germany) as injected brines (highly saline formation water) have much lower electrical resistivity than the oil within the reservoir. The main focus of this study is on controlled-source electromagnetic simulations to test the sensitivity of various source–receiver configurations. The background model for the simulations is based on two-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data gathered across the oil field and calibrated with resistivity logs. Three-dimensional modelling results suggest that controlled-source electromagnetic methods are sensitive to resistivity changes at reservoir depths, but the effect is difficult to resolve with surface measurements only. Resolution increases significantly if sensors or transmitters can be placed in observation wells closer to the reservoir. In particular, observation of the vertical electric field component in shallow boreholes and/or use of source configurations consisting of combinations of vertical and horizontal dipoles are promising. Preliminary results from a borehole-to-surface controlled-source electromagnetic field survey carried out in spring 2014 are in good agreement with the modelling studies.},

Time-lapse tomographic processing of one well pair revealed the signature of the injected plume, two zones of decreased P-wave velocity which spatially correspond to higher permeability sections of the reservoir unit. We then used White's model for patchy saturation, combined with secondary information from core and well-log measurements, to convert the imaged changes in P-wave velocity into estimates of supercritical (sc) CO2 saturation in the interwell region. Our estimate is relatively consistent with existing lithologic and core data as well as independent measurements of scCO2 saturation derived from pulsed neutron logging.

Electrostatic, or direct current (DC) resistivity, experiments form the basis of our understanding of the physics of grounded source experiments in terms of charges, currents, and electric fields. Steel-cased wells are highly conductive, and although their presence makes numerical modeling more challenging, they can help targets of interest be detected because they channel charges and currents to depth. Time-domain EM experiments use a time-varying transmitter current. Understanding the EM response requires that we consider both galvanic, or DC, currents as well as image currents that are induced in the subsurface. As compared to DC experiments, the physics of EM is more complex because of the multiple current systems as well as the need to consider magnetic permeability of steel-cased wells. However, EM experiments have the advantage that they can provide a large data set that is sensitive to a target of interest.

	abstract = {If CO2 released from fossil fuel during energy production is returned to the subsurface, will it be retained for periods of time significant enough to benefit the atmosphere? Can trapping be assured in saline formations where there is no history of hydrocarbon accumulation? The Frio experiment in Texas was undertaken to provide answers to these questions.One thousand six hundred metric tons of CO2 were injected into the Frio Formation, which underlies large areas of the United States Gulf Coast. Reservoir characterization and numerical modeling were used to design the experiment, as well as to interpret the results through history matching. Closely spaced measurements in space and time were collected to observe the evolution of immiscible and dissolved CO2 during and after injection. The high-permeability, steeply dipping sandstone allowed updip flow of supercritical CO2 as a result of the density contrast with formation brine and absence of a local structural trap.The front of the CO2 plume moved more quickly than had been modeled. By the end of the 10-day injection, however, the plume geometry in the plane of the observation and injection wells had thickened to a distribution similar to the modeled distribution. As expected, CO2 dissolved rapidly into brine, causing pH to fall and calcite and metals to be dissolved.Postinjection measurements, including time-lapse vertical seismic profiling transects along selected azimuths, cross-well seismic topography, and saturation logs, show that CO2 migration under gravity slowed greatly 2 months after injection, matching model predictions that significant CO2 is trapped as relative permeability decreases.},

At the time of the first repeat survey (22–25kt of CO2), the CO2 plume was found to be concentrated around the injection well with a maximum lateral extent of approximately 300–400m and a thickness of 5–20m. Data from the 2012 survey (61kt of CO2), show further growth and migration of the amplitude anomaly interpreted to be induced by the CO2 injection. The anomaly is similar in shape to that obtained from the 2009 survey, but significantly stronger and larger by ∼150m in the N–S direction and by ∼200m in the E–W direction. In agreement with the 2009 survey, the new data show a westward propagation of the plume, a trend governed by the complex structure of the reservoir. No evidence of systematic changes in the seismic signature within the overburden is observed. A quantitative assessment of the plume reveals a 15\% discrepancy with the injected amount, which could be attributed to the ongoing dissolution processes. However, the estimated quantity also contains significant uncertainty.},

            AUTHOR SUMMARY
            Recent public opposition has caused setbacks to high-profile onshore CCS projects in Europe, such as Shell’s Barendrecht project, and Vatenfell’s in the Altmark. However, the Otway Project demonstrates that this opposition is not inevitable. As a range of our results are published, they reemphasize that geological carbon storage is sufficiently well-understood, scientifically and technically, to be scaled up to its key role in combating global warming. It is particularly important to have demonstrated that monitoring techniques are practical and quantitatively adequate to ensure safety, protect financial and physical assets, and guarantee climate abatement. No single project can answer all questions or remove all doubts, but our measurement of capacity is an empirical finding that shows previous estimates to be well-founded: There is large, useful capacity, worldwide, in depleted gas reservoirs. Obstacles to using this capacity are more social and political than scientific or technical.
            
              It is important to know the capacity of subsurface storage for CO
              2
              . The global volumetric pore space is large, but the realistic storage capacity is diminished by many practical factors such as depth, the presence of suitable sealing rocks, or distance from sources. In the case of depleted gas fields, an important factor is the ability of injected CO
              2
              to reoccupy the pore space formerly containing natural gas. The potential capacity in depleted gas fields has been estimated to be significant on a global scale (
              5
              ). By monitoring the rate of filling as we injected CO
              2
              into the Naylor field, we made an initial direct measurement of this important parameter in CO
              2
              storage. Although dependent on detailed circumstances, for example, rock type or when storage begins after production ceases, our data adds weight to the conclusion that depleted gas fields have enough storage capacity to make a significant contribution to reducing global emissions.
            
            
              Repeated seismic surveys attained a sensitivity that would have detected small leakages into deep aquifers just above the storage reservoir. Atmospheric monitoring demonstrated sensitivity at usefully small rates. Direct fluid sampling at the Naylor well showed good agreement between the predicted and observed CO
              2
              concentrations as the injected gas accumulated at the apex of the reservoir. A sustained program of monitoring of shallow potable aquifers and of soil gas content over the injection zone showed no anomalies. Although it is not logically possible to demonstrate no leakage, we showed how to quantify our nondetection of anomalies, thus demonstrating that undesirable levels of leakage could be detected in large-scale storage projects.
            
            
              The monitoring of storage is a unique aspect of CCS that requires multidisciplinary skills. Clearly, there are basic safety issues associated with large volumes of CO
              2
              , but monitoring for immediately hazardous leakage is unproblematic. However, large-scale CCS deployment depends on associated financial rewards that will require monitoring over longer periods. Slow leakages into potable aquifers or the root zone are also concerns. Finally, CCS will be worse than useless if the stored CO
              2
              escapes back into the atmosphere, even very slowly, and leakage rates of less than 10\% per thousand years are required for long-lasting climate benefits (
              4
              ). The Otway Project explored a comprehensive suite of monitoring techniques and showed that the necessary degree of quantification is within reach.
            
            
              Ultimately, key performance indicators were agreed upon with the state Environmental Protection Agency, and the injection well was drilled, surface and downhole equipment was installed, and injection of naturally occurring CO
              2
              /CH
              4
              from the nearby Buttress field commenced on March 18, 2008. Between March 2008 and August 2009, 65,445 t were stored, after which injection ceased. The storage site was the 2-km deep Naylor reservoir, from which natural gas had been commercially produced from 2002 to 2003. The CO
              2
              was injected about 300 m from the apex of the Naylor structure, and migrated under buoyancy over 4 mo to pool under the remaining natural gas. The original extraction well was reinstrumented to observe this process and recover samples of fluids as the CO
              2
              arrived, displacing water and natural gas.
            
            
              Most aspects of this process are well-known in the oil and gas industry, but experience with CO
              2
              is relatively limited, and political sensitivities mandate caution. Consequently, our modeling and risk assessments dealt explicitly with probabilities, which in turn had to be communicated to stakeholders so that permissions and associated regulation could be established. A sustained and structured program of engagement with the local community was pursued throughout this phase of the project (
              3
              ).
            
            
              To demonstrate storage on a significant scale, public consent must be secured: The lesson learned from other international projects is that public opposition can easily escalate and be fatal to the project, and has cumulative effects on the vulnerability of other projects. The regulatory environment must be clearly understood, and if not comprehensive, additional permits may have to be negotiated. The best possible model of the relevant geology must be assembled, and the eventual fate of the injected CO
              2
              must be simulated. Knowledge of the deep subsurface is always incomplete, so it is crucial to consider a range of cases that bound possibilities. Risk assessment can commence once models are developed, based partly on empirical information and partly on expert judgment; if the risks are low or manageable, construction of the infrastructure to inject the CO
              2
              can begin.
            
            
              The Otway Project is located in the state of Victoria, Australia, about 200 km west of Melbourne in the Otway Basin. The project’s objective was to be a pathfinder for CCS in Australia, developing a range of techniques for monitoring storage and setting an international example of transparency and accountability. The choice of a depleted gas field was partly motivated by the significant global capacity that was thought to be available in these structures. The project area is fairly prosperous dairy farming country, with good rainfall and dense settlement by Australian rural standards (
              Fig. P1
              ).

              Although increasing atmospheric CO
              2
              levels will cause climate changes that pose serious risks to humanity, fossil fuels will evidently continue to be used for decades (
              1
              ). Large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be needed to meet this challenge (
              2
              ). Despite the success of several industrial CCS projects, this technology (particularly storage) is controversial and seen as risky by some of the public. Open and transparent demonstration storage projects are critical both because they test scientific understanding and expectations, and also place processes, procedures, and regulations within the space of public discussion. The Otway Project successfully demonstrated midscale storage within a depleted gas field. Our measurement of its storage efficiency provides important physical confirmation of theoretical estimates that depleted gas fields could safely and effectively store many decades worth of CO

About 1 year after stopping the CO2 injection, we again collected formation fluid using a Cased Hole Dynamics Tester (CHDT) at one of the three observation wells where CO2 breakthrough was confirmed by time-lapse well logging. Chemical analyses of the post-CO2 injection samples indicate a high HCO3− concentration compared to original formation water. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Si also increased. The field results were quite similar to the laboratory experiments on CO2–water–rock reactivity. Our results demonstrated the potential of CO2 storage by formation water dissolution and mineral trapping of CO2.},

	abstract = {We analyze the electromagnetic fields arising in the vicinity of a vertical steel casing due to the excitation of a vertical electric field antenna placed in the borehole below the casing shoe. Numerical simulations of the fields were used to investigate the distorting effect of the casing on surface observations and in turn to define a distributed dipolar source to independently model the secondary fields arising due to the casing. The analysis indicates that the casing effect is mainly galvanic in nature, dominated by the conductivity of the metallic medium, with changes of the magnetic properties causing only small variations to the fields observed on the surface. Variations of the casing thickness also result in small perturbations to the fields; however, as the thickness decreases, the amplitude of the fields is first observed to increase and then to decrease. These observations are further investigated using approximate closed-form expressions derived for the surface impedance of the casing. The current induced on the casing was analyzed as a function of the resistivity distribution of the surrounding formation. The secondary field arising due to the presence of the casing was shown to be reproduced approximately by an array of dipole sources describing the continuous distribution of the current along the pipe. A method was tested in which the current was evaluated in a simplified configuration of the surrounding formation to reduce the computational burden. The approximate equivalent dipole array is then used to compute the open-hole response representative of the secondary casing response, which is in turn superimposed to that of the primary source located below the casing shoe. The resulting fields were found to describe the true response of the system very well, including the metallic casing.},

	abstract = {Controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) can be used to image subsurface resistivity and add value in petroleum exploration. However, the application of CSEM methods can be particularly challenging in mature oil and gas fields, where the presence of steel casings and complex seabed infrastructure may influence electromagnetic (EM) fields. The effect of this metal infrastructure can be modeled using the method of moments (MoM), which has previously been demonstrated to be effective in simple situations. We have now developed a methodology for modeling the EM response of complex pipeline geometry using MoM, and we validate our approach numerically and experimentally; the difference between finite-element and MoM modeling is less than 3\%, whereas the difference between experimental data and MoM results is less than 30\%. We further develop a fast and efficient approach to model the EM response of horizontal pipeline infrastructure. First, we create individual pipe sections of custom shape; when assembled, these sections are used to construct the entire pipeline system. We then identify “precise” and “approximate” zones based on how accurately we need to perform the calculations. We find that the electric field values in the approximate zone can be calculated accurately and quickly using previously saved table values, and therefore achieve a considerable reduction in computational requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to a real situation of a 60 km horizontal seabed pipeline and find that the electric field distortion can be calculated rapidly and efficiently with our custom-built algorithm.},

	abstract = {In oil and gas production environments, controlled-source electromagnetics can be used to aid brownfield exploration, development, and reservoir monitoring efforts. However, such environments typically have many highly conductive steel-cased wells in the area of interest. We have developed a modeling algorithm using a method of moments (MoM) approach to calculate the electromagnetic response of multiple 3D steel-cased wells of arbitrary geometry in a layered earth conductivity model. This approach involves dividing each casing into a collection of segments, each carrying a uniform current density. A matrix is computed that describes how the casing segments interact with each other electromagnetically. Then, we solve a linear system for the current within each casing segment, given a transmitter of arbitrary frequency and location. From these currents we are able to solve for the secondary electromagnetic fields produced solely by the casings at any point in our layered model, and we add these to the primary fields produced by the transmitter. To validate the algorithm, we compared results with a pseudoanalytic MoM algorithm for a single vertical casing in a half-space. We also compare results with a finite-element solution using Comsol Multiphysics for vertical and single tilted wells buried in various layered earth models. Our results indicate a good match between these different approaches, with tilted casings in a layered model requiring further study. Finally, we applied our algorithm to a realistic synthetic model with three casings (one vertical and two deviated) extending into a layered earth model containing the classic thin resistive layer. This example illustrates how the algorithm can be used to compute the electromagnetic response of multiple steel casings. The example also illustrates how the electromagnetic field changes due to the presence of the casings and how the casings may be used to inject the signal at depth.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data, acquired above the Sleipner CO2 storage, in order to further study the dataset and conclude the feasibility of marine CSEM for offshore CCS monitoring. There are some challenges with respect to CSEM in this particular area: 1) strong airwave influence (due to regional shallow water depth); 2) potential of weak resistivity anomaly; 3) seabed pipeline network; and 4) rather shallow target depth. We are yet able to extract useful information; interpret further the CSEM inversion results by combining seismic data; and to extract the in situ resistivity and saturation of CO2 in the Utsira formation by applying a rock physics model. In addition, to minimize the influence of the seabed pipeline on the CSEM data, we have muted some of data and receivers near the seabed pipeline network. The results show a good agreement with seismic data, and the estimated total mass of CO2 agrees well with the injection data. This current study confirms that the marine CSEM can be an important and essential tool for offshore CO2 storage monitoring, yet not alone but when combined with both seismic and gravity. Finally, near-future large-scale CCS projects in the North Sea would require extensive infra-structures such as seabed pipeline, etc. This study demonstrates that CSEM may work even with such infra-structures in place.},

	abstract = {The self-potential (SP) method is expected to play an important role in the exploration of Seafloor Massive Sulfide (SMS) resources. Since the redox potential changes with depth below the seafloor, SMS deposits are the source of an electrical (source) current density, generating in turn a recordable electrical field. This electrical field can be remotely measured at and above the seafloor. By integrating this electrical field, we obtained a so-called SP profile or map. The electrical conductivity distribution of SMS deposits is an important ingredient in the inversion of these SP data in order to distinguish between causative primary sources (i.e. associated with the SMS deposits themselves) and secondary current sources associated with conductivity contrasts below the seafloor. Such ingredient is therefore necessary to properly localize SMS deposits and eliminating ghosts associated with high conductivity contrasts. The conductivity structure of the seafloor is however unknown in most SP surveys. This study presents the first joint interpretation of transient electromagnetic and SP survey. The field data were acquired at the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal mound. The conductivity structure of TAG mound was obtained by inverting transient electromagnetic (TEM) data. This electrical conductivity distribution is then used to invert the SP data. The obtained (primary) source current distribution delineates the geometry of the SMS deposits. The deposits are located in the center of the mound as well as at its edges, in a way that is consistent with water column data. Combining the two geophysical methods improves our ability to better decipher the fine geometry of SMS deposits below the sea floor.},

The new arguments which are here set forth are the proper accounting for the topographic effects and a robust approach to global 3D tomography. The 2D case is initially considered in order to facilitate a full understanding of the new method. In order to gauge the topographic distortions, the concepts of slope effect and surface regularization are introduced, as suitable means to compute point by point correction factors of the measured self-potential data, prior to the recognition of the tomographic images of the primary and induced electric sources underground. The tomographic approach is then developed by introducing again the concepts of the scanning function and of the charge occurrence probability function, which were amply dealt with in the previous paper. The new approach to 3D global tomography means here the composition of charge occurrence probability functions related to any two orthogonal surface components of the natural electric field, in order to account fully for the total surface component of the self-potential field and hence to elicit the greatest amount of information. Two field examples are presented to show the full effectiveness of the proposed method. They refer, respectively, to a near-surface investigation for archaeological purposes and to a very deep investigation in an active volcanic area.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe immediate objective of a geophysical survey is to obtain some information about the interior spatial distribution of one or more of the earth's physical properties from a limited set of measurements of a related physical field made on the earth's surface (or another accessible place). In the case of an electromagnetic (EM) induction survey, the most relevant physical property is the electrical conductivity, and it is sensed by means of a time-varying magnetic and/or electric field. The procedure of converting field measurements to a physical property distribution is termed modeling or interpretation, and the formal corresponding mathematical process is termed inversion.Geophysical inversion is difficult in the best of circumstances because of numerous intrinsic ambiguities. For EM methods in particular there is an additional problem. The basic laws that relate the EM field to the physical property distribution are well known (Maxwell's equations) and a quantitative and calculable relationship between the physical measurements and the property structure can be established for certain idealized cases. However, we still lack practicable modeling capabilities that enable quantitative prediction of the EM field configuration produced by an arbitrary physical property distribution of even moderate complexity.Geologic scenarios are extremely varied, and few actual cases can be described accurately in terms of simple geometric forms like plane horizontal layers. Thus, only rarely can we feasibly turn geophysical observations directly into a reliable picture of earth structure simply by application of an automatic process. Generally, a human interpreter is still needed to guide the interpretation process, and this human needs to have a good qualitative understanding of how physical earth structure can interact with EM fields. In addition the interpreter should be able to mentally extrapolate beyond calculable cases and to select more important features of the data from less important ones. Our objective in this tutorial paper is to assist readers in developing such an ability by discussing the various physical processes which arise in some simple situations.},

The present paper presents the theoretical basis of the method in a unified format. Part of the material is derived from valuable published papers which are difficult to obtain. The remainder of the paper contains original unpublished theoretical results. It is shown that a horizontally layered earth yields no MMR anomaly. The characteristic anomalies for an anisotropic earth, vertical and dipping contacts, thin and thick dikes, and semicylindrical and hemispherical depressions, as well as alpha media are presented in detail. There are two factors which influence the MMR anomaly; geometry and conductivity contrast. For many models, it is possible to separate these two effects. Type curves are presented for very large conductivity contrasts to illustrate the effect of geometry only. Ancillary curves enable finite conductivity contrasts to be deduced from field data.},

Over one range of frequencies, eddy-current density in any given sphere and secondary magnetic fields of the sphere are relatively constant and high. Over a much lower range of frequencies eddy currents are negligible, but the secondary magnetic fields may be of large constant amplitude but of polarity reversed to that of the higher frequency range. At some intermediate frequency the secondary magnetic fields will be entirely quadrature with respect to the inducing field. Utilization of this peculiar frequency dependence and of the geometry of the secondary magnetic fields permits unique determination of the conductivity, permeability, radius, and depth to the center of a buried sphere. The procedure for obtaining these variables is described in this article.As an added feature, it is shown that by completing a gravity survey as well as an electromagnetic survey over a dense, magnetic, conductive spherical ore body, it is possible to determine the above variables, plus density, uniquely. Precise identification of the material of the sphere is seen as a possible result of the application of this technique.},

These processes can be the result of magnetic fields due to eddy currents in electrical conductors or due to displacement currents from dielectric processes or magnetic fields associated with direct magnetic loss phenomena. In the past, most attention has been focused on eddy-current losses since this is the dominant effect. Dielectric losses also may be of importance, particularly at high frequencies, where the conductivity is extremely low or where the dielectric properties become anomalously high. In general, however, little attention has been given to magnetic losses and the effect they might have on the electromagnetic response parameter. Magnetic minerals do have a measurable magnetic loss due to various mechanisms. This effect has been measured in a frequency range from 125 to 5000 hz for a variety of samples. In synthetic samples with varying amounts of magnetite dispersed in a nonmagnetic matrix the effect is linearly proportional to the magnetite content. The magnetic loss causes a distinct, but small, change in the electromagnetic response of a body. The effect can be detected, provided the peak frequency of magnetic loss is lower than the peak frequency of electrical loss. The most diagnostic feature is the reversed phase relationship from the electrical response (for constant geometries).},

	abstract = {The information content of data from an in-phase quadrature electromagnetic (EM) system consists of a combination of conductive eddy current response and magnetic polarization response. The secondary field resulting from conductive eddy current flow is frequency-dependent and consists of both in-phase and quadrature components of positive sign. Conversely, the field resulting from magnetic polarization is commonly frequency-independent and consists of only an in-phase component of negative sign.A magnetite mapping technique was developed for the horizontal coplanar coils of a closely coupled multicoil airborne EM system. The technique yields contours of apparent weight percent magnetite when using a homogeneous half-space model. The method can be complementary to magnetometer mapping in certain cases. Compared to magnetometry, it is far less sensitive but is more able to resolve closely spaced magnetite zones. The method is also independent of remanent magnetism and magnetic latitude. It is sensitive to .25 percent magnetite by weight when the sensor is at a height of 30 m above a magnetitic half-space. It can individually resolve steeply dipping narrow magnetite-rich bands which are separated by 60 m.},

	abstract = {While the inversion of electromagnetic data to recover electrical conductivity has received much attention, the inversion of those data to recover magnetic susceptibility has not been fully studied. In this paper we invert frequency-domain electromagnetic ( E M )data from a horizontal coplanar system to recover a 1-D distribution of magnetic susceptibility under the assumption that the electrical conductivity is known. The inversion is carried out by dividing the earth into layers of constant susceptibility and minimizing an objective function of the susceptibility subject to fitting the data. An adjoint Green’s function solution is used in the calculation of sensitivities, and it is apparent that the sensitivity problem is driven by three sources. One of the sources is the scaled electric field in the layer of interest, and the other two, related to effective magnetic charges, are located at the upper and lower boundaries of the layer. These charges give rise to a frequency-independent term in the sensitivities. Because different frequencies penetrate to different depths in the earth, the EM data contain inherent information about the depth distribution of susceptibility. This contrasts with static field measurements, which can be reproduced by a surface layer of magnetization. We illustrate the effectiveness of the inversion algorithm on synthetic and field data and show also the importance of knowing the background conductivity. In practical circumstances, where there is no u priori information about conductivity distribution, a simultaneous inversion of EM data to recover both electrical conductivity and susceptibility will be required.},

	abstract = {The transient electromagnetic (TEM) response of a wire loop at the surface of the earth has been studied in detail for several decades. When current in the loop is rapidly switched off, an identical system of current, commonly referred to as a “smoke ring,” is induced in the conductive subsurface and diffuses downward and outward into the earth. What has not been studied as thoroughly is the response of a loop buried within a conductive medium, as might be the case in the marine environment or when TEM prospecting systems are placed in mine tunnels or horizontal boreholes. We have examined the TEM response of a horizontal wire loop buried within a conductive half-space. Expressions were derived for the azimuthal electric field and corresponding vertical and radial magnetic fields. Our results showed that when the loop is far from the earth-air interface, a single smoke ring system diffuses radially outward from the transmitter, while the electric field and corresponding current density decays away in the vertical direction. As the loop approaches the interface, the smoke ring system diffuses radially at early times, but gradually, the complex image of the loop in the air produces a system of secondary azimuthal electric fields, which, when combined with the primary field, adds a vertical component to the field diffusion. At late times, the field behavior reduces to the well-known surface case and the maximum current system diffuses downward at a constant angle of 26° with respect to the plane of the loop. We concluded that it was the effect of the interface that produces the downward migration of a smoke ring system, whereas the outward migration is mainly generated by the primary field.},
